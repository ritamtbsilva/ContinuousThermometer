# ContinuousThermometer
Implementation on the ESP32 board of a temperature processing model for the MLX90614 and MCP9808 sensors, in order to obtain a reliable continuous temperature measurement. The main motivation for this project was the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for a low-cost thermometer for continuous measurement of body temperature.
